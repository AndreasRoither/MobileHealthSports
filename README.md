## Project Setup

- Install Flutter and Dart
  - <https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install>
- Setup Flutter in Path (so u can use it in console later)
  - From the Start search bar, enter ‘env’ and select Edit environment variables for your account.
  - Under User variables check if there is an entry called Path:
    - If the entry exists, append the full path to flutter\bin using ; as a separator from existing values.
    - If the entry doesn’t exist, create a new user variable named Path with the full path to flutter\bin as its value.
  - You have to close and reopen any existing console windows for these changes to take effect.
    - You can run `which flutter dart` to see if it worked which should give you the location of the folders
- Run `flutter doctor` to check what you are still missing
